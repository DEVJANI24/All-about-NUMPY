3. Array Indexing and Slicing
Concept:
Access elements using indices.
Supports slicing for subarray creation.

Syntax:
# Accessing elements
element = arr[1]

# Slicing
sub_array = arr[1:4]

Examples:
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
# Indexing
print(arr[2])  # Output: 30
# Slicing
print(arr[1:4])  # Output: [20, 30, 40]

Questions for your self-Practice:
Extract the second column from a 2D array.
Retrieve every alternate element from an array.
