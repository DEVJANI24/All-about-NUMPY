2. Array Operations
Concept:
Arrays support element-wise operations, broadcasting, and mathematical functions.

Syntax:
# Element-wise addition
result = arr1 + arr2

# Broadcasting
result = arr1 + 5

Examples:
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Element-wise addition
print(a + b)

# Broadcasting example
print(a * 2)

Questions your self-practice:
Multiply a 1D array with a scalar value.
Perform element-wise addition of two 2D arrays.
