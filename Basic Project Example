Project: Weather Data Analysis

Objective: Analyze temperature data of a city over a week using NumPy.

Steps:
Create a NumPy array with daily temperatures for a week.
Compute the following:
1.Average temperature of the week.
2.Maximum and minimum temperatures.
3.Days with temperatures above the average.

Code Example:
import numpy as np
# Temperature data (in Celsius)
temps = np.array([22.5, 24.8, 19.2, 23.4, 21.8, 20.1, 25.3])

# Average temperature
avg_temp = np.mean(temps)

# Maximum and minimum temperatures
max_temp = np.max(temps)
min_temp = np.min(temps)

# Days with temperatures above average
above_avg = temps[temps > avg_temp]

# Results
print("Average Temperature:", avg_temp)
print("Maximum Temperature:", max_temp)
print("Minimum Temperature:", min_temp)
print("Days Above Average Temperature:", above_avg)
